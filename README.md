🧑‍💻 CRUD Operations – Users can Create, Read, Update, and Delete data through a responsive user interface and RESTful API.

⚙️ REST API – Built with Express and connected to a MongoDB database to handle all backend operations.

🌐 Frontend – Developed with React, providing a dynamic and interactive user experience.

📦 Backend – Node.js and Express handle API routing, authentication middleware, and database interactions.
